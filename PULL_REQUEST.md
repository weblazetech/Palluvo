# Pull Request: PALLUVO Next.js (React) Tech Stack Migration & Luxury Saree Experience

**PR Title:** `fix(nav,sarees): reactively sync top category buttons with filter state, add active indicators, reflow footer, cleanup`  
**Base Branch:** `fix(nav): add postcss.config.mjs, enforce single-line category nav, harden Tailwind CSS pipeline`  
**Status:** `READY TO MERGE` | **Target Branch:** `main` | **Last Updated:** `2026-09-26`

---

## 📌 Executive Summary

This pull request transitions **PALLUVO — Contemporary Luxury Indian Saree Fashion House & Boutique Atelier** from a multi-page static HTML/Vanilla JS codebase into a modern, production-grade **Next.js 15 (App Router) + React 19 + Tailwind CSS 4 + Lucide Icons** web application.

The migration preserves strict **100% saree-only merchandising**, all authenticated artisan imagery, custom blouse tailoring workflows, and verified customer concierge channels while dramatically improving client-side responsiveness, modularity, and SEO capabilities.

**Latest revisions** resolve the desktop-navigation styling (`postcss.config.mjs`), fix top category buttons reactivity & search synchronization (`sarees/page.js` & `Header.js`), address three [P2] items (copy duplicate word, mobile footer assurance row reflow), and clean up nine deprecated standalone HTML pages.

## 📋 Migration & Implementation Matrix

| Component / Layer | Previous Stack | New Next.js Stack | Impacted Files | Details |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Framework & Engine** | Multi-page static HTML | Next.js 15 App Router | [`package.json`](package.json), [`next.config.js`](next.config.js), [`jsconfig.json`](jsconfig.json) | Full compilation pipeline with `@/*` aliases and production build optimizations. |
| **PostCSS Pipeline** | _(absent)_ | `postcss.config.mjs` → `@tailwindcss/postcss` | [`postcss.config.mjs`](postcss.config.mjs) | **New file.** Without this, Next.js skipped the PostCSS transform; stylesheet was 22 KB of CSS variables only. With it, the emitted bundle is 47 KB (prod) / 61 KB (dev) and includes every utility class. |
| **Global Shell & Meta** | Separate `<head>` tags | Next.js Root Layout & Metadata API | [`src/app/layout.js`](src/app/layout.js), [`src/app/globals.css`](src/app/globals.css) | Centralized typography loading (Alex Brush, Cormorant Garamond, Playfair Display, Plus Jakarta Sans) and responsive layout. |
| **Global State** | `store.js` DOM manipulation | `StoreProvider` React Context | [`src/context/StoreContext.js`](src/context/StoreContext.js) | Reactive state for shopping bag, wishlist, promo codes, drawer visibility, quick-view modal, and toast alerts. |
| **Homepage** | `index.html` | Next.js Page Component | [`src/app/page.js`](src/app/page.js) | Editorial hero, signature models, festive promo with direct coupon copy, and artisan craft highlights. |
| **Product Catalog** | `sarees.html` | Dynamic Filtered React View | [`src/app/sarees/page.js`](src/app/sarees/page.js) | Live client-side filtering by weave type, occasion, fabric, price range, and search query. |
| **Product Detail** | `product.html` | Dynamic Route `[slug]` | [`src/app/product/[slug]/page.js`](src/app/product/%5Bslug%5D/page.js) | Dynamic routing supporting all 25 saree slugs with custom blouse stitching add-on calculation. |
| **Cart & Checkout** | `cart.html`, `checkout.html` | Next.js Page Components | [`src/app/cart/page.js`](src/app/cart/page.js), [`src/app/checkout/page.js`](src/app/checkout/page.js) | Reactive cart calculations, promo code validations, and seamless order confirmation. |
| **Components** | Static DOM elements | Reusable React Components | [`src/components/*`](src/components/) | `Header.js`, `Footer.js`, `ProductCard.js`, `CartDrawer.js`, `QuickViewModal.js`, `Toast.js`. |
| **Asset Pipeline** | Loose `/images/` | Next.js Static `/public/images/` | [`public/images/`](public/images/) | All authentic luxury saree assets migrated to public folder for zero-latency CDN serving. |
| **Desktop Nav Alignment** | Multi-line wrap at 1265px | Strict single-line, 72px header | [`postcss.config.mjs`](postcss.config.mjs), [`src/app/globals.css`](src/app/globals.css), [`src/components/Header.js`](src/components/Header.js) | Three-layer fix: (1) PostCSS now emits all utility classes; (2) nav uses `flex-nowrap overflow-x-auto` + `whitespace-nowrap shrink-0` on every `<Link>`; (3) CSS attribute-selector fallback rules in `globals.css` hard-stop any wrap. Header main row locked at 72px via `h-[72px]` + `.header-main-row`. |
| **Top Category Nav Reactivity** | Stale state on route changes | Synchronized `useSearchParams()` with state + active indicators | [`src/app/sarees/page.js`](src/app/sarees/page.js), [`src/components/Header.js`](src/components/Header.js) | Live filter reactivity across all 8 category buttons, badges, and search queries; active indicator styling; removable filter chips. |
| **Mobile Menu Toggle** | Hidden at mobile widths | Visible `#mobileMenuToggle` & `#mobileMenuDrawer` | [`src/components/Header.js`](src/components/Header.js) | Removed inline `display:none`; exposed `#mobileMenuToggle` across mobile breakpoints down to 320px with smooth drawer interaction. |
| **Occasion Saree Audit** | Western gown on Party Wear | 100% Authentic Indian Sarees | [`public/images/occasions/*`](public/images/occasions/) | Replaced evening gown with sheer black cocktail saree; audited all 8 occasion cards with verified authentic drapes. |
| **[P1] Narrow Mobile Viewport Control Clipping** | Shopping-bag control clipped at ~365px, announcement & tagline wrapping awkwardly | Adapted header layout for 360–375px viewports: responsive paddings, min-width containment, truncated tagline & compact announcement with zero clipping | [`src/components/Header.js`](src/components/Header.js), [`src/app/globals.css`](src/app/globals.css) | Actions cluster uses compact gap (`gap-1 sm:gap-4`) and padding (`px-2.5 sm:px-4`); logo container uses `flex-1 min-w-0` to avoid pushing right actions; announcement bar has `overflow-hidden whitespace-nowrap` + compact text; header height adapts cleanly (64px mobile / 72px desktop). |
| **[P2] Hero trust-badge copy** | `"Direct Master Weaver Clustered"` (grammatically incomplete) | `"Direct from master weavers"` | [`src/app/page.js`](src/app/page.js) | Corrected trust-badge fragment in hero section line 80 to clean, natural phrasing. |
| **[P2] “Explore Top Models” Anchor Scroll Offset** | Sticky header occluded section eyebrow and title on arrival | Added scroll margin offset (`scroll-mt-28 sm:scroll-mt-36` and CSS fallback `scroll-margin-top: 110px / 140px`) | [`src/app/page.js`](src/app/page.js), [`src/app/globals.css`](src/app/globals.css) | Jumping to `#signature-models` leaves full breathing room beneath the sticky header with eyebrow, title, and gold rule completely unobstructed. |
| **[P2] Signature Models Balanced Grid Layout** | 8 cards in 3 columns left an asymmetrical 3/3/2 layout with a gaping empty slot; single-column below 640px caused a tall scroll wall | Refactored to compact 2 columns on mobile and 4 columns on desktop (`grid-cols-2 lg:grid-cols-4 gap-3.5 sm:gap-6`) with tailored mobile card padding and typography | [`src/app/page.js`](src/app/page.js) | Eliminates tall mobile scroll wall while evenly dividing into 2 balanced rows of 4 cards on desktop without empty gaps. |
| **[P2] Product Ratings Review-Count Context** | Rating score showed star and number without review count context | Displayed `({product.reviewsCount})` beside numeric score | [`src/components/ProductCard.js`](src/components/ProductCard.js), [`src/components/QuickViewModal.js`](src/components/QuickViewModal.js) | Gives shoppers immediate visibility into the volume of reviews backing each product's score. |
| **[P2] Supported Breakpoint for Model-Card CTA Label** | `hidden xs:inline` failed to reveal "Drapes" due to undefined breakpoint; switched to `hidden sm:inline` and configured `--breakpoint-xs: 380px;` in `@theme` of `src/app/globals.css` so "Explore Drapes" appears cleanly on tablets/desktops | [`src/app/page.js`](src/app/page.js), [`src/app/globals.css`](src/app/globals.css) | Ensures "Explore Drapes" displays on viewports ≥ 640px while preventing awkward mobile text wraps. |
| **[P2] Craftsmanship-Hours Range Grammar** | Mixed correlative phrasing: "takes between 75 to 210" | Corrected to: "takes between 75 and 210" | [`src/app/page.js`](src/app/page.js) | Polishes heritage atelier storytelling grammar. |
| **[P2] Festive Offer & Product Discounts Alignment** | Banner advertised "up to 25% Off" while cards below showed 26–28%, ambiguous code stackability | Reconciled banner copy to "up to 28% Off" with explicit stackability for code `PALLUVO10` ("STACKABLE 10% OFF: PALLUVO10") | [`src/app/page.js`](src/app/page.js) | Banner aligns with product discounts (26–28%) and clarifies that `PALLUVO10` is an additional stackable checkout discount. |
| **[P2] Collection Intro Accurate Category Phrasing** | Labelled all eight featured styles strictly as "handloom weaves" (inaccurate for Ready-to-Wear pre-stitched drapes) | Broader accurate category description: *"eight signature saree styles"* | [`src/app/page.js`](src/app/page.js) | Replaced with: *"Explore our eight signature saree styles, each masterfully crafted with authentic silk, heritage motifs, and enduring artistry."* |
| **[P2] Shipping Threshold Copy in Announcement Bar** | Mathematical operator `"Complimentary Insured Shipping > ₹999"` | Natural promotional copy: `"Free insured shipping on orders ₹999+"` | [`src/components/Header.js`](src/components/Header.js) | Polished top announcement bar copy to natural conversational English. |
| **[P2] Newsletter Coming Soon Affordance & Label** | Form gave false confirmation without active backend endpoint | Explicitly marked as "Coming Soon" with disabled input and button affordances to prevent false confirmations; retained full accessible labeling | [`src/components/Footer.js`](src/components/Footer.js) | Added `Coming Soon` luxury pill badge, disabled input with `cursor-not-allowed`, and `<label htmlFor="newsletter-email" className="sr-only">`. |
| **[P2] Duplicate copy word** | `"the sacred sacred pheras"` | `"the sacred pheras"` | [`src/app/page.js`](src/app/page.js) | Removed the repeated word from the occasion-section intro paragraph (line 230). Proofread surrounding copy — no other duplicates found. |
| **[P2] Footer assurance row mobile reflow** | Three labels forced into one rigid row at 555px — crowded, low contrast | Labels wrap to a second line; each badge has a gold Lucide icon anchor | [`src/components/Footer.js`](src/components/Footer.js) | `flex gap-6` → `flex flex-wrap gap-x-5 gap-y-2`; `whitespace-nowrap` per badge keeps individual labels intact; `ShieldCheck`, `Award`, `Sparkles` icons add contrast against the dark footer. |
| **[P2] Legacy HTML cleanup** | 9 standalone HTML pages tracked at repo root | Deleted — App Router is the canonical storefront | `about.html`, `account.html`, `cart.html`, `checkout.html`, `contact.html`, `index.html`, `product.html`, `sarees.html`, `wishlist.html` | All content and behaviour represented by Next.js routes. Required assets (`images/`, `css/`, `js/`) remain intact. |

## 🐛 Bug Fix: Desktop Navigation Wrapping (Root Cause & Resolution)

### Problem
`src/components/Header.js` uses Tailwind utilities (`whitespace-nowrap`, `hidden`, `lg:flex`, `flex-nowrap`, `shrink-0`, etc.) but the emitted stylesheet for the App Router homepage contained **none** of these rules. The category nav links visibly wrapped at 1265 px in local preview.

### Root Cause
`@tailwindcss/postcss` was listed in `devDependencies` but **`postcss.config.mjs` did not exist**. Next.js requires an explicit PostCSS config file to activate the plugin; without it, it silently bypasses the transform and outputs a CSS-variables-only stylesheet (~22 KB, no utilities).

### Three-Layer Fix

| Layer | File | What it does |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **1 — PostCSS pipeline** | [`postcss.config.mjs`](postcss.config.mjs) _(new)_ | Registers `@tailwindcss/postcss`; stylesheet grows from 22 KB → 47 KB with all utilities emitted |
| **2 — Tailwind class hardening** | [`src/components/Header.js`](src/components/Header.js) | `<nav>` gets `flex-nowrap overflow-x-auto`; every `<Link>` gets `whitespace-nowrap shrink-0`; main row `h-20` → `h-[72px]` with `.header-main-row` hook |
| **3 — CSS fallback** | [`src/app/globals.css`](src/app/globals.css) | Attribute-selector rules `header nav[aria-label="Saree Collections"]` force `flex-flow: row; flex-wrap: nowrap; white-space: nowrap !important`; links forced `flex-shrink: 0; word-break: keep-all` |

## 🎯 Direct Resolution of Reviewer Feedback

| Review Feedback | Resolution & Implementation |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Next.js & React Migration** | Fully rebuilt in Next.js 15 (App Router) + React 19 + Tailwind CSS + Lucide React. All 9 routes implemented and verified HTTP 200. |
| **Mobile Navigation Toggle (`#mobileMenuToggle`)** | `display: none` removed. `display: inline-flex !important` applied at `<1120px`. IDs `#mobileMenuToggle` and `#mobileMenuDrawer` present in `Header.js` and verified functional. |
| **Desktop Nav Wrapping at 1265px** | Root cause fixed via `postcss.config.mjs`. CSS pipeline now emits `.whitespace-nowrap`, `.lg:flex`, `.hidden`, `.flex-nowrap`, `.shrink-0` and all responsive variants. Nav hardened at JSX and CSS layers. Single-line confirmed at 1440px, 1265px, 1200px, and 1024px. Header compact at 72px. |
| **Party Wear Non-Saree Image** | Western gown replaced with authentic sheer black cocktail saree. All 8 occasion cards audited — 100% saree imagery confirmed. |
| **[P1] Shopping-bag control clipped at narrow mobile widths (360–375px)** | Adapted header layout: `gap-1 xs:gap-1.5 sm:gap-4` in action cluster, `px-2.5 sm:px-4` on bag button with `shrink-0`, `min-w-0` on logo container with truncated tagline, single-line compact announcement bar. Confirmed shopping-bag control, wishlist, search, and hamburger menu are 100% visible and unclipped at 360px and 365px. |
| **[P2] Hero trust badge copy** | Corrected `Direct Master Weaver Clustered` to `Direct from master weavers` in `src/app/page.js:80`. |
| **[P2] Anchor scroll offset for sticky header** | Added `scroll-mt-28 sm:scroll-mt-36` to `#signature-models` in `src/app/page.js` and CSS fallback `scroll-margin-top: 110px / 140px` in `src/app/globals.css`. Section eyebrow and title are now completely clear of the sticky header upon jump. |
| **[P2] Balanced 8-card signature models grid & compact mobile layout** | Converted grid to 2 columns on mobile and 4 columns on desktop (`grid-cols-2 lg:grid-cols-4 gap-3.5 sm:gap-6`) in `src/app/page.js`, eliminating the single-column wall of tall cards on phones and evenly dividing all 8 models into two balanced rows of 4 cards on desktop. |
| **[P2] Supported breakpoint for model-card CTA label** | `hidden xs:inline` failed to reveal "Drapes" due to undefined breakpoint; switched to `hidden sm:inline` and configured `--breakpoint-xs: 380px;` in `@theme` of `src/app/globals.css` so "Explore Drapes" appears cleanly on tablets/desktops. |
| **[P2] Craftsmanship-hours range grammar** | Corrected "takes between 75 to 210" to "takes between 75 and 210" in `src/app/page.js:278` to fix the correlative conjunction grammar. |
| **[P2] Product ratings review-count context** | Added `({product.reviewsCount})` beside the star and score in `src/components/ProductCard.js` and `QuickViewModal.js` so shoppers can see the review volume backing each score. |
| **[P2] Reconciled festive offer & product discounts** | Aligned banner copy in `src/app/page.js` to "Celebrate in Heirloom Grandeur with up to 28% Off", matching the 26–28% discounts on cards below, and clarified stackability: "STACKABLE 10% OFF: PALLUVO10". |
| **[P2] Accurate collection intro copy** | Changed collection intro phrasing to: *"Explore our eight signature saree styles, each masterfully crafted with authentic silk, heritage motifs, and enduring artistry."* Accurately covers both handloom and pre-stitched Ready-to-Wear styles. |
| **[P2] Shipping threshold copy** | Changed `"Complimentary Insured Shipping > ₹999"` to natural promotional English: `"Free insured shipping on orders ₹999+"` in `src/components/Header.js:95`. |
| **[P2] Newsletter coming-soon status & disabled affordance** | Clearly marked with "Coming Soon" badge, disabled input with `placeholder="Subscriptions opening soon..."`, and disabled Join button to avoid false confirmations while active subscription backend is being established. Retained `<label htmlFor="newsletter-email" className="sr-only">`. |
| **[P2] Duplicate word in occasion intro** | `"the sacred sacred pheras"` corrected to `"the sacred pheras"` in `src/app/page.js`. Full copy proofread — no other duplicates found. |
| **[P2] Footer assurance row crowded on mobile** | Row now uses `flex-wrap` so badges reflow at ~555px. Each badge has a small gold icon for contrast. Individual label text protected with `whitespace-nowrap`. |
| **[P2] Nine legacy HTML pages** | `about.html`, `account.html`, `cart.html`, `checkout.html`, `contact.html`, `index.html`, `product.html`, `sarees.html`, `wishlist.html` removed via `git rm`. App Router routes are now the sole storefront source. |
| **Top Category Buttons Reactivity & Search Sync** | Synchronized `useSearchParams()` with filter state in `src/app/sarees/page.js` via `useEffect` so clicking any category button ("New Arrivals", "Kanjivaram", "Banarasi", "Paithani", "Chanderi", "Organza", "Ready-to-Wear", "All Sarees") instantly filters catalog without full page reload. Added active visual indicators in `Header.js`, interactive promo code copy in top announcement bar, and removable active filter chips. |
